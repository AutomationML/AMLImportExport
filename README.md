# AMLImportExport
Example implementations of import export algorithms for AutomationML data.

You will find here examples for the implementation of **AutomationML export and import algorithms.** The examples are based on specific design patterns. Detailed explanations as well as the code examples can be found in the [AutomationML cook book](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110745979/html).

The published source code illustrates these implementations as a guided walkthrough.
